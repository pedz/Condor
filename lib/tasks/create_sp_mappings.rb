# This is also a stop gap script.  One problem is that the service
# pack to fileset mappings may need to be deleted before the script is
# run.  There is also now way to do partial updates.

# The concept is that the path of the image implies which SP the
# fileset is in.  The mapping creates the mapping which I created
# visually.  I may need to tweak it if I  find problems.

# We then run through each image on that path and each fileset in the
# image and set a service_path_fileset_map to join the fileset with
# the service pack.

# The alternative would be to run through Betty's HTML files which I
# may look at again.  The concept of a fileset to SP mapping is
# actually pretty vague it seems.
