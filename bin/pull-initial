# This is a script that pulls over all of the pc_view entries in
# groups of 1000 using the id of the pc.  The script does not depend
# upon anything else in the Rails application.  It will consume about
# 10Meg of file space with the temp files.  The temp files are loaded
# via import_pc_views.rb.  See comments there for details.

# At the time, I found that the ids for pc_view stopped before 160000
# Pull pc_view entries in groups of 1000
