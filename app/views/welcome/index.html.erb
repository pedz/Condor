<h1>Welcome to Condor</h1>
<p>
  Condor is the CMVC / RP2 half of my web based tools to help with
  support work.  There are three big areas to Condor.
  <ol>
    <li>"swinfo" data.  This is the ptfapardef.constant information
    produced by the build group.  Currently, there is no ties to RP2.
    If that occurs it will be a batch update to populate the local
    database because RP2 is too slow.</li>
    <li>Packaging data.  The install images on truth stored in
    /530images, 520images, ... have been ransacked.  Each image path
    has been opened to get each install package.  Each fileset has
    been pulled out of each install package.  And each AIX file path
    associated with each fileset has been pulled out.  In effect, this
    is a which_fileset database but it knows what actually shipped and
    where -- not what was suppose to ship.</li>
    <li>The third piece is a few ties to CMVC to pull over Defects,
    source files, and features such as changes done for a defect,
    diffs between source files, and things like that.  Over time, I
    plan to move my CMVC bash / perl scripts into this tool.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>swinfo</h3>
<p>
  Enter a defect, APAR, PTF, Lpp name (e.g. bos.rte) or Fileset
  (e.g. bos.rte 5.3.0.30 -- with the space.  The VRMF can be
  incomplete)
  <% form_tag "/swinfos", :method => "get" do -%>
      <%= text_field_tag "item" %>
      <%= submit_tag nil, :class => "concat-fields" %>
  <% end -%>
</p>
<h3>Which Fileset</h3>
<p>
  Type in a file name or path
  <% form_tag "/which_filesets", :method => "get" do -%>
      <%= text_field_tag "path" %>
      <%= submit_tag nil, :class => "concat-fields" %>
  <% end %>
</p>
<h3>CMVC Activities</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <% form_tag "/defects", :method => "get" do -%>
        Retrieve CMVC Defect:
        <%= text_field_tag "path" %>
        <%= submit_tag nil, :class => "concat-fields" %>
      <% end %>
    </li>
    <li>
      <% form_tag "/changes", :method => "get" do -%>
        View changes for CMVC Defect:
        <%= text_field_tag "path" %>
        <%= submit_tag nil, :class => "concat-fields" %>
      <% end %>
    </li>
  </ul>
